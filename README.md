A program created to simulate an assembly line system for processing and fulfilling customer orders through various stations. The assembly line consists of a set of workstations each of which holds a set of stock items, which are specific to the station. A line manager moves customer orders along the line filling the orders at each station, as requested. Each customer order consists of a list of items that need to be filled. Each station processes a queue of orders by filling the next order in the queue if that order requests the station's item and that item is in stock. The line manager keeps moving the customer orders from station to station until all orders have been processed. Any station that has used all the items in stock cannot fill any more orders. At the end of the line orders are either completed or incomplete due to a lack of inventory at one or more stations. The simulator lists the completed orders and those that are incomplete once the line manager has finished processing all orders.

The contents of the pre-determined customer order information and the inventories of the various stations are stored as text documents. The program reads and extracts the data (CSV or using the pipe character as delimiters - see the example files in the project repo) and tokenizes the records, trimming any whitespace; it should be run with these files as command-line arguments. Serial numbers are generated for all of the stock items. The program outputs a formatted summary of the various stations, the pending customer orders, the assembly line order, the processing and fulfillment of the stock items requested in the customer orders, and the final status of all the orders after they have been processed by the assembly line system. The program distinguishes if the customer orders were fulfilled or incomplete due to one or more stock items being unavailable in the inventory, displaying details for the status of every item on each customer order.

Incorporates various object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, STL containers and algorithms, dynamic memory handling and resource management, lambdas, error handling, copy and move semantics, and namespaces.
